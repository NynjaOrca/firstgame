I'm pretty new to Java and I found your tutorial the most helpful out of any tutorial I've seen (out of like 5 or 6). 
So I got through all of what you had available for BEGINNER GAME PROGRAMMING and ended up wanting to do more. 
I've found many discussions and examples on how to implement gravity in a 2D environment but the way the source code is 
set up makes it hard to implement.
