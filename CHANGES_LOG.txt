Changes: Added GRAVITY; 
	 Made some changes to tile sizes that can be easily reverted from the TILE abstract class;
	 The changes made to tile sizes required me to make changes to the world map. So now the map
	 is basically an arena surrounded by 'solid' blocks and filled with 'non-solid' blocks with
	 one pillar of solids to test collision on.;
	 Some issues with collision include MOVING LEFT. That may be the only thing because IF you are
	 MOVING LEFT and trying to JUMP, the character gets pushed below the 'solid' block it's standing on.
	 Hopefully resolving the left bounds issue fixes this problem as well.
